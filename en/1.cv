CV
<h4>A Short Introduction</h4>
<p>
    I've been programming
    <a href="https://kaeruct.github.io/posts/origins.html">
        since I was 12 years old</a>.
    What I have learned so far can be summarized as "the less code the
    better".
</p><p>
    However, we live in the real world, so I have learned to cope with
    gigantic codebases and have gotten used to spending hours debugging
    through strange code written before I even graduated from high school.
</p><p>
    In my spare time, I enjoy making and listening to music,
    playing old video games, and working on my own side&#8209;projects.
    I'd love to show you all my music but no one ever seems to ask...
