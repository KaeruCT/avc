Software Developer
<p>
    I'm a pragmatic web developer and software engineer.
    I'm passionate about the web, frontend technologies, and the open source ecosystem.

    In my spare time, I enjoy making and listening to music,
    playing old video games, and working on my own side&#8209;projects.
